# Sawtooth ROS2 Quadruped Robot

**Sawtooth** is a quadruped robot project built to be fully compatible with ROS2. It integrates perception, control, navigation, simulation, and teleoperation into a modular architecture. The goal is to provide a flexible platform for research, experimentation, and deployment of quadruped locomotion and autonomy.

(“Inspired by the Sawtooth from Horizon Zero Dawn” — fan project, not affiliated with the game.)
